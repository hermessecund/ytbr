# cosmic.io

An alternate and better frontend to [astronaut.io](http://astronaut.io/) - a website showcasing random obscure YouTube videos.

[Hosted on suxin.space](http://suxin.space/cosmic-io/)

Made with [**react**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**react-youtube**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-youtube), bundled using [**vite**](https://vitejs.dev/)

[astronaut.io](http://astronaut.io/) was originally made by [Andrew Wong](https://github.com/wonga00) and [James Thompson](https://github.com/astrojams1), it's still hosted only via HTTP, meaning it's not possible to host this frontend statically on HTTPS.
